## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

### What I learned

This project was really challenging to me. I found out multiple things that I can improve in general but I discovered how important itâ€™s to make a good plan before writing code. The reason why is simple, I can reduce the amount of refactors needed when my project gets bigger. In this way, I recognize that thinking of a critical route approach will generate a better understanding of the project and it will show me key features to focus on.
 
Separately, speaking more technically, I enjoyed this challenge due to the things I have implemented. Firstly, I wanted to build my code around the TDD technique. So, I started developing the tests and then the code without thinking about styles. This was difficult to achieve but I tried my best to see the importance of producing testable code. Many things appeared during the time I worked on creating tests and code that made me refactor again and again my lines. I consider I gained a lot by doing this because of the knowledge acquired with each failure. Now, I feel that my code still needs some refactors to make it more performant but this will lead to a bunch of questions that could be solved later on.
 
In addition, I perceive I did an interesting exercise by trying to base my styles on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and mix this up with CUBE CSS. I was curious about the implementation of multiple utility classes and how to create them dynamically with SASS loops, mixins and functions. I think this helped me to increase my skills at the time of writing CSS. See below a mixin that creates utility classes for properties that use custom values and return a class selector depending on the breakpoint received:

```scss
@mixin units($label, $breakpoint: null) {
    $property: map-get($properties, $label);

    @each $unit in $units {
        $unit-formated: replace-dot(#{$unit});

        @if $breakpoint {
            .#{$breakpoint}\:#{$label}-#{$unit-formated} {
                #{$property}: multiply-units($unit);
            }
        } @else {
            .#{$label}-#{$unit-formated} {
                #{$property}: multiply-units($unit);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

On the other hand, I didnâ€™t understand how to create a custom hook. This project gave me an idea on how to fulfill it. Therefore, I added a simple animation on my modal that apply the custom hook below:

```js
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

export const useAnimationOnUnmount = (setMount) => {
    const [isComponentSet, setIsComponentSet] = useState(false);
    const componentRef = useRef();

    const setComponentToUnmount = (ref) => {
        componentRef.current = ref;
        setIsComponentSet(true);
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        if (componentRef.current) {
            componentRef.current.addEventListener('animationend', () => {
                setMount(false);
            }, { once: true });
        }
    }, [setMount, isComponentSet]);

    return {
        setComponentToUnmount
    };
}
```

It performs a reusable functionality to let a component that is being unmounted to finish its animation before disappearing suddenly. In other words, this is like animating `display: none;`.

### Continued development

I wanted to apply TDD on this one. However, this was challenging enough to make me think about the importance of keeping practicing this technique to discover more and more of its benefits. Since I was used to developing the software first, starting with testing was a game changer. I tried my best on creating good tests but I recognize that at the beginning it is difficult to get the specific mindset needed to build strong tests. I found TDD really interesting and I will continue implementing this technique on new projects to keep myself learning and discovering potential issues that can be mapped with the help of unit testing.
 
Apart from that, one thing I can strengthen is thinking more before doing. It is convenient to do so due to the potential issues that will appear if you start writing code without identifying the project structure and how requirements are linked to each other. I had to handle numerous situations in which I could have prevented them from happening.
 
Finally, I realized that my repo got a bunch of commits. Some of them could have been grouped instead of sending them separately to the remote repo. This is more of a branch strategy consideration that can help me to keep my work clean once I send it to my main branch. So, I am contemplating starting to create branches that focus on particular features or bug fixes.
